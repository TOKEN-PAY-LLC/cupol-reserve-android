[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- An exit node deployed by the node wizard never actually connected: a
  `.conf`-only `Role = exit` (every node-wizard deployment) left the core's
  internal exit/client flag stuck at its pre-config value, so the exit
  never answered the handshake and crash-looped instead. Bumps `OpenFlux`
  to [`e8f735a`](https://github.com/p1neappleXpress/OpenFlux/commit/e8f735a98c1ba9e091956416fde5c5ef92d3cd66).
- The startup log always printed `Transport: yandex` for session/multi-transport
  profiles regardless of which transports were actually configured (a stale
  flag default, not a functional bug — the correct transports ran either
  way). Now prints the actual list, e.g. `Transport: boards, direct (session)`.
- Cups.online profiles with no room codes couldn't be saved or connected;
  the node generates its own rooms, so an empty value is valid for this
  transport only.

### Added

- Node-wizard deployment logging: every SSH/RPC call and the wizard's own
  step narration now goes to the Logs tab, so a stuck deployment is
  diagnosable without a debugger.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-27

First release of this app. Replaces the previous single-transport native
app (tun2socks + pdnsd JNI, preserved at the
[`legacy-native-app`](../../tree/legacy-native-app) tag) with the Compose
Multiplatform app originally built by [@meepo161](https://github.com/meepo161)
in [OpenFluxClient](https://github.com/meepo161/OpenFluxClient), moved here
with his agreement.

### Added

- System VPN or local SOCKS5.
- Multi-transport sessions with automatic failover and priority-based
  switching (including `direct`).
- AES-256-GCM session encryption.
- SmartCaptcha and login handling in a built-in browser, including a
  transport check on the exit node, passed through the tunnel from its
  own address.
- A node-deployment wizard: install an exit node on your own VPS over SSH
  from the app.
- `shared/` and `OpenFlux/` as git submodules ([OpenFluxClientShared](https://github.com/p1neappleXpress/OpenFluxClientShared)
  and the [OpenFlux](https://github.com/p1neappleXpress/OpenFlux) core), so
  this app always builds against one pinned, single copy of each instead of
  a vendored one.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: a `v*` tag builds and signs a release
  APK and publishes it here.

  scan screens build on.
